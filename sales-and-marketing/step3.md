# Knowing your customers

In order to satisfy your customer's needs you need to know the current trends. Who better to ask what they are looking for than your own customers? 

The recent sales numbers are stagnating and your boss wants you to conduct a survey. 

>>Is there anything you need to consider?<<
[] I can ask anything I want.
[] As long as I ask among our registered customers, I can ask anyting.
[*] I should only ask what I need to help me understand the current customer needs.
[] If they don't have to provide their name, I can collect anything that might be necessary for the company.

A colleague has heard about your task. He tells you that his project team is discussing about conducting a survey in the future as well. To reduce the amount of work he suggests to combine your tasks and wants you to add some questions whose answers his team eventually need later as well. 

>>How should you respond?<<
( ) Of course, it's a good idea to combine the work.
(*) The team should first work out the details of their task and conduct a survey when they know for sure what information they need.
( ) It's good to have plenty of information to work with in order to create a well-founded plan for future actions.
( ) Since you have nothing to do with his project, he should do his task seperately.

To draw your customers attention and to have as many responses as possible, your team decided to provide a lottery win for a randomly drawn participant. To let everyone know about the winner, you're asked to publish an announcement on your website by writing a short post.

So, let's do this.
- Navigate in the menu to the tab `Posts`.
- Click the butten `Add New` next next to the title for opening the editor panel to create a new blog entry.
- Give your post an eye-catching title, e.g. `Congratulations!!!`{{copy}}
- Write an opening paragraph to let the reader know to which event you are referring to, e.g. `Thanks to everyone who participated in our survey to help us improve our service! Among all the participants we randomly selected our winner to receiving a US$ 200 shopping voucher.`{{copy}}

Now it's time to reveal the winner. Of course you have all the details about your customer at hand, but there are limitations to what extent you are allowed to publish them.

>>What information can NOT be used in the post?<<
( ) First name, e.g. "Congratulation to our winner Alice!"
( ) Abbreviation of the first name together with the city, e.g. "Winner: B. from Hong Kong"
(*) Surname with date of birth, e.g. "Winner: Mrs. Smith (09.05.1973)"

**Please bear in mind:** 
Your customers entrusted you with some personally identifiable information when they signed up. Nevertheless, that does not give you the permission to use and publish all of the data that is stored in our applications database. 
Make sure you abide the current law and the company's policies regarding information privacy. If you are insecure about what you can or can not publish, it is a good idea to confer with your in-house attorney first.
