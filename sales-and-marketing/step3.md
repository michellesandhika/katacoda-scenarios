# Knowing your customers

In order to satisfy your customer's needs you need to know the current trends. Who better to ask what they are looking for than your own customers? 

The recent sales numbers are stagnating and your boss wants you to conduct a survey. 

>>Is there anything you need to consider?<<
[] I can ask anything I want.
[] As long as I ask among our registered customers, I can ask anyting.
[*] I should only ask what I need to help me understand the current customer needs.
[] If they don't have to provide their name, I can collect anything that might be necessary for the company.

A colleague has heard about your task. He tells you that his project team is discussing about conducting a survey in the future as well. To reduce the amount of work he suggests to combine your tasks and wants you to add some questions whose answers his team eventually need later as well. 

>>How should you respond?<<
( ) Of course, it's a good idea to combine the work.
(*) The team should first work out the details of their task and conduct a survey when they know for sure what information they need.
( ) It's good to have plenty of information to work with in order to create a well-founded plan for future actions.
( ) Since you have nothing to do with his project, he should do his task seperately.

To draw your customers attention and to have as many responses as possible, your team decided to provide a lottery win for a randomly drawn participant. To let everyone know about the winner you want to publish an announcement on your website.

>>What information can't be used?<<
( ) Congratulations Alice! You're the winner of our survey-lucky-draw.
( ) Congratulations B. from Hong Kong! You're the winner of our survey-lucky-draw.
(*) Congratulations C. Smith (09.05.1973)! You're the winner of our survey-lucky-draw.
