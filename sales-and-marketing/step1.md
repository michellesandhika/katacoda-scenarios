# Access the website

Choose your preferred language
- e.g. Language: `English`

Give the website a title
- e.g. Site Title: `ARTS & more`

Enter your username
- e.g. Username: `salesperson`

Enter your password
- Let's assume you've chosen `1234`
The website will indicate it's `very weak`.

>>What's the problem?<<
[*] The password is too short
[ ] The password is probably used by someone else too
[*] The password only consists of numbers
[*] The password is guessable

>>What is/are (a) better option(s) for choosing a password?<<
[ ] Using a very long word from a dictionary
[*] Come up with a long password consisting of different kind of characters/numbers
[*] Using a password-manager who randomly generates a password
[ ] Using the hard-to-guess password you use for your social media account

You chose a more complex password than `1234`. Good! But this password is harder to remember than something like `1234`, right?

>>How to deal with this problem?<<
[*] Try to remember i by creating a story around it
[ ] Write it on a post-it and stick it on your screen
[*] Visualise it in your head
[ ] Tell it to your trusted colleage
[*] Use a password-manager tool or some similar storage no one other than yourself has access to

Be warned: If someone knows your credentials, that person can act viciously in your name.

*For example: The most essential part for an eCommerce store are the displayed goods with its corresponding price. Assuming a malicious user likes to harm the company and got hold of your credentials. This person then can easily access the website and has the possibility to manipulate the products and/or its price on the website. Depending on the backup and the system as well as the severeness of the manipulation, it may take a while until the store is set back to its original state.*

>>What might be a consequece?<<
[*] Loss of your job
[*] Loss of the company's reputation
[*] Loss of customers
[*] Loss of revenue
