The website will indicate it's `very weak`.

>>What's the problem?<<
[*] The password is too short
[ ] The password is probably used by someone else too
[*] The password only consists of numbers
[*] The password is guessable

>>What is/are (a) better option(s) for choosing a password?<<
[ ] Using a very long word from a dictionary
[*] Come up with a long password consisting of different kind of characters/numbers
[*] Using a password-manager who randomly generates a password
[ ] Using the hard-to-guess password you use for your social media account

You chose a more complex password than `1234`. Good! But this password is harder to remember than something like `1234`, right?

>>How to deal with this problem?<<
[*] Try to remember i by creating a story around it
[ ] Write it on a post-it and stick it on your screen
[*] Visualise it in your head
[ ] Tell it to your trusted colleage
[*] Use a password-manager tool or some similar storage no one other than yourself has access to

Be warned: If someone knows your credentials, that person can act viciously in your name.

>>What might be a consequece?<<
[*] Loss of your job
[*] Dismissal of the colleagues who acted in your name
[*] Loss of reputation of the company
[*] Loss of customers

**Don't treat password handling lightly!**
