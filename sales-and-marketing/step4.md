# Creating Email Subscription Forms

Email subscriptions help create a loyal and returning customer base, whenever there are new offers or items in our store, customers can be informed immediately through email subscriptions.

However, nothing lowers subscription rate more than violating customer's privacy, our company needs to hold up the credibility and trust customers' expect. In Article 5 of the GDPR, the law states that personal data should be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed”. In other words, when we design a form for data collection, the forms should only acquire information that is relevant and needed.

>>Therefore, when creating an email subscription form on the website, we should only acquire:<<
[] First and Last name
[ * ] Email address
[] Home address
[] Credit card information
