# Blocking or Disabling Comments
Suspicious, inappropraite or spam comments are inevitable on a website. This could be a threat to the users because they may be tricked, and also our company because it ruins the aesthetic layout of the website. 

However, our company still wants to balance between customer interaction and security, therefore we opt for filtering certain comments, and users.

It is your job, to notice different types of risky comments, and put a change to it by following the steps below.

The below are some examples.

### 2.1 Find the IP address and email address
Instead of adding the keyword to the blacklist, the user poses a threat to the community. 

Hence, we directly add their IP and email address to the blacklist.

Go to "Comments" on WordPress, and copy their IP and email address.
