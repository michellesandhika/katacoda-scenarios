From the provided contact information it likely looks as if this user is a regular customer. But you shouldn't blindly trust your longtime customers nor some new ones. Whether if it's unintentionally or a planned attack on your website. Clicking on a provided link might lead you to a malicious website or triggers a download of malicious content. 

Therefore, make sure before you click, that the page the customer is referring to is a trusted website. If for example the link looks like it's a well known website but when looking closer it seems to have a typo in it, it might be deliberately misleading the user.
