# Exporting Personal Data
As a sales and marketing team member, there will be times when you receive emails from customers requesting for their personal data, or maybe you will need their data to complete a task in your job.

WordPress allows you to do this by pressing the "Export Personal Data" function in the "Tools" Section.

However, there are several steps to take before downloading their personal data. This tutorial aims to tell you the steps to take before downloading the personal data.
