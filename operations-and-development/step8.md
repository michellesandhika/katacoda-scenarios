# Change Admin Login Page

One of the ways that normal customer login to Wordpress is by going to the default admin login page like `/wp-admin` or `/login`. Thus, changing the URL of the admin login page is one of the best practices to improve wordpress security.

To change this URL, we have to install the plugin WPS Hide Login from the Wordpress Plugin tab and config the settings.
